> Learn path connectivity concepts in graph theory through interactive urban planning simulation

## 🎯 About
TopoLab is an educational web application that teaches **connectivity** and **disconnectedness** concepts from **graph theory** and **topology** through an interactive city-building simulation.

## ✨ Features
- 🏗️ **Build cities** with different building types (houses, hospitals, schools, etc.)
- 🛣️ **Create connections** (roads, bridges, metro lines, walkways)
- 🔍 **Analyze connectivity** with real-time topological analysis
- 🎮 **Educational challenges** with step-by-step exercises
- 📊 **Generate detailed reports** with mathematical insights
- 💾 **Save/Load** your city designs

## 🧠 Educational Concepts Covered
- **Path Connectivity** in topological spaces
- **Connected Components** in graph theory
- **Network Resilience** and vulnerable connections
- **Minimum Spanning Trees**
- **Bridges** and critical connections

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Add buildings** by selecting a type and clicking on canvas
2. **Connect buildings** by dragging from one to another
3. **Analyze** your city's connectivity
4. **Complete challenges** to learn specific concepts
5. **Generate reports** for educational insights
